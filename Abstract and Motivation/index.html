					<h5 class="lead my-3">Abstract:</h5>
					<p>The simulation is able to reflect different scenarios based on the user's selection of different
						input variables.</p>
					<p>The user has different values depending on which variable they are allowed to change, such as
						switching the rate of inflation from value A to value B.</p>
					<p>Additional, the user needs to manage the TNR efforts through decisions on how to manage its
						queues, inventory, type of delivery and amount of workers in the stations. Most of the factors
						are attached to a cost, so optimizing their numbers within the given scenario is key in reducing
						both costs and mega-zombies.</p>
					<p>Singapore has a growing issue is its number of cats. Furthermore, if the policy to ban cats
						living in HDB is lifted, there will be an exponential surge in the amount of cats living in
						Singapore. Potential rising inflation rates could then hike up the cost of keeping a cat and
						thus force owners to abandonment them.</p>
					<p>Finally, strays cats which are not neutered tend to breed excessively which leads to the
						proliferation public health hazards such as bacteria growth.</p>

					<h5 class="lead my-3">Motivation:</h5>
					<p>We hope to simulate the effects of pet abandonment and the effectiveness of
						TNR(Trap-Neuter-Release), to raise awareness on the effects of animal abandonment and abuse.</p>
