			<p>Cats are widely loved by people as pets, especially Singaporeans. There is a growing demand for the
				felines as pets throughout the years and especially during Covid-19, when everyone enjoyed the perks of
				working at home as well as the low inflation rates. Moreover, the HDB ban on cats has been brought to
				question by the public, if it should be lifted.</p>
			<P>In the scenario where the ban is lifted, there would be an expected surge in demand for cats, the number
				bolstered by HDB homeowners. Coupled with the growing trend of pet abandonment in relation with the
				higher inflation rates, we can expect to have a growing rate of stray cats too.
			</P>
			<p>The Singapore government currently does not employ a stringent TNR program for stray cats. Hence, our
				current research and simulation in JaamSim is done with the purpose of bringing awareness to users, as
				to what will happen in the future based on varying factors such as inflation rate, TNR efforts and more.

				“A 2007 survey found that 92% of cats over 6 months of age are neutered; however, only 66% of cats aged
				6–12 months of age are neutered, leaving much potential for unplanned litters (Murray et al, 2009). <br>
